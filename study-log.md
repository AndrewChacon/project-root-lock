Some of the topics that became fuzzy for me where timing options and navigating firewalls, I think I just need more chances to apply those things to really get it. As for advanced scanning, it felt overwhelming seeing just how many flags and options you have. Its a lot to take in but ill focus on remembering the most common ones found over the more situational ones. 
I still need more time for the methodology to sick in, that's just a matter of experience over time from practicing more. 
If I can finish this week quicker id like to send more time understanding how to navigate firewalls better. Id also like a chance to learn more about networks and how they work at a lower level.

I think one useful thing I did today that ill start building up a habit of is, while I'm learning, finish learning the tool or concept but jot down things I didn't fully understand. After I finished I researched them, I think if I did this during the process it would have lead to more confusion. Finish the task then go back for edge cases. 
I had questions/uncertainties about things like how whatweb fingerprinting worked, how recursion in `fuff` worked, how subdomain enumeration worked in `gobuster`, and what the difference between directory brute forcing vs fuzzing was. After I finished the days agenda I went back and added notes that answered those questions I had. 
Towards the end of the week I should write a methodology sheet for steps to attacking a victim like running `nmap`, then running `fuff` and `gobuster` scans, etc. 
I scanned on the HTB machine called `bashed` I got some pretty good progress investigating it, I don't think I was too far from rooting it even though that wasn't a part of today's plan.
