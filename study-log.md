Some of the topics that became fuzzy for me where timing options and navigating firewalls, I think I just need more chances to apply those things to really get it. As for advanced scanning, it felt overwhelming seeing just how many flags and options you have. Its a lot to take in but ill focus on remembering the most common ones found over the more situational ones. 
I still need more time for the methodology to sick in, that's just a matter of experience over time from practicing more. 
If I can finish this week quicker id like to send more time understanding how to navigate firewalls better. Id also like a chance to learn more about networks and how they work at a lower level.
