### 🧭 What’s Next?

You’re now **fully qualified to move into:**
- **TryHackMe / Hack The Box** boxes without walkthroughs
- Building a **portfolio of rooted machines + reports**
- Going head-on into **OSCP prep** 
- Creating your own internal CTF lab to practice persistence & lateral movement

### 💡 Want Ideas?

Just say the word and I’ll help you:
- Build a post-course hacking roadmap 🎯
- Set up your own vulnerable AD lab 🏰
- Prep for eJPT or OSCP 🧠
- Build a hacker portfolio to show off to employers 📁

But for now?  
**Celebrate. You’ve earned it.** 🥂

Proud of you, hacker. What do you want to conquer next?

📈 Next Level: Automate your recon flow with bash or Python, integrate `httpx`, `subfinder`, `amass`, and maybe even build your own recon script.

📈 Next Level: Learn **manual exploitation**, develop your own payloads with `msfvenom`, and dive into **buffer overflows** or **exploit development** basics.

📈 Next Level: Explore **Active Directory attacks**, **Kerberoasting**, **lateral movement**, and **custom persistence techniques** (e.g., registry keys, scheduled tasks, etc.)

📈 Next Level:
- Practice bug bounty-style testing on platforms like **PortSwigger Academy**, **TryHackMe web labs**, or **Hack The Box Web challenges**
- Dive deeper into Burp Suite and learn session hijacking, CSRF, and IDOR

📈 Next Level:
- Create **OSCP-style reports**
- Practice writing for non-technical audiences (exec summaries)
- Build a **portfolio of “rooted boxes + reports”**

You’re operating at a **junior penetration tester / OSCP-prep** level. You’ve got real skills, not just theoretical knowledge. You’ve proven you can exploit real boxes, escalate privileges, and document it — that’s more than most people do before their first job or cert.

---
### 🔥 What You’re Ready For Now

- TryHackMe Offensive Path → Complete
- Hack The Box Starting Point + Easy/Medium boxes
- eJPT certification (you’ll crush it)
- OSCP prep (you already have the foundation)
- Building your own cyber lab for lateral movement & AD attacks

Want me to help you write a **next-phase roadmap** based on this skillset? Or do a mock “OSCP-style exam readiness” checklist for you?

### ✅ What You’ve Already Got (Why You’re at 65%)

#### 🧠 **Foundations Locked In**
- You know networking, ports, Linux/Windows CLI
- You’ve done real exploit work, including EternalBlue, Jenkins, bruteforcing, web fuzzing
- You’ve post-exploited, used `meterpreter`, dumped hashes, done local privilege escalation
- You switched to Linux natively — that shows deep commitment and comfort in a hacker’s workspace
#### 🛠️ **You’re Comfortable with Tools**
- `nmap`, `gobuster`, `hydra`, `ffuf`, `sqlmap`, `msfconsole`, `linPEAS`, etc.
- You’ve scripted, used Go tools, cloned GitHub projects, installed from source
- You understand tool output and what to do with it
#### 📁 **You’ve Done Labs Like Blue and Butler**
- Real exploitation, not just theory
- You’ve done full kill chains (recon → exploit → post → loot)

### ❌ What’s Missing (Why You’re Not at 100%)
#### 🧠 **Manual Exploitation**
- OSCP wants **manual SQLi**, **manual buffer overflows**, **manual Linux priv esc**
- If you can’t do an RCE without Metasploit, you’ll get stuck
#### 🧠 **Buffer Overflow**
- This is a must. You’ll need to:
	- Understand EIP control
	- Use `pattern_create`, `pattern_offset`, `msfvenom`
	- Write shellcode and execute it manually in a BOF

#### 🏰 **Active Directory / Pivoting**
- OSCP boxes often include **Windows domains**
- You need to be able to:
	- Enumerate users with `rpcclient`, `smbclient`, `BloodHound`
	- Abuse Kerberoasting, AS-REP roasting, weak permissions
	- Use SSH tunnels or `chisel` for **pivoting**
#### 🔓 **No Hints Allowed**
- OSCP is 100% hands-off
- You need to root **3-4 boxes in 24 hours** **without walkthroughs**
- You need full muscle memory for: reverse shells, file transfers, privilege escalation paths, web attacks
#### 📋 **Reporting**
- You must document every step clearly with proof (screenshots, commands, outputs)
- If you don’t submit a proper report, **you fail**, even if you rooted everything

### 💡 OSCP “Exam” Simulation Test
Here’s what I’d ask you to do _without hints, walkthroughs, or ChatGPT_:
- Buffer Overflow lab → write your own exploit
- Exploit 1 Linux and 1 Windows box manually (no Metasploit)
- Escalate to root/SYSTEM using manual methods
- Create a full OSCP-style report with screenshots and command logs

If you can do that now? You’re **85–100% ready**.

If not yet? You’re exactly where most smart learners are around **2–3 months before OSCP prep officially begins**.

## 🧭 What To Focus On Next (To Hit 100%)

|Area|Goal|
|---|---|
|**Buffer Overflow**|Do the Vulnserver BOF labs (Free from TCM)|
|**Manual Exploits**|Exploit services without Metasploit: use `nc`, `curl`, etc.|
|**AD & Pivoting**|Hack `TryHackMe: Attacktive Directory`, use BloodHound, do pivots|
|**Linux Priv Esc**|Go beyond linPEAS → practice SUID abuse, cron jobs, PATH hijacks|
|**Reporting**|Write your own pentest-style reports with screenshots + commands|
|**Exam Practice**|Try a 24-hour box rooting challenge: no help, just tools & notes|

## 🔥 Phase 0: Define the OSCP Endgame

**To pass OSCP**, you must:
- Root 3/5 machines in 24h exam (at least 2 manually)
- Do a buffer overflow by hand
- Write and submit a detailed professional report
- Operate without hints, walkthroughs, or hand-holding

### 🔥 10-Week Balanced Bluelock Build

**Ideal for:** Deep, high-quality prep with aggressive pacing but recovery windows.
