## ⚔️ What Is Project Root Lock?

**Project Root Lock** is not a course.  
It is not a walkthrough.  
It is your **awakening**.

A 10-week, uncompromising protocol engineered to forge red teamers into OSCP-tier predators.  
You will:
- Learn the science of enumeration.
- Master the art of escalation.
- Tear through AD forests like fire through dry leaves.
- Leave no service unowned. No box unrooted.

You will become the hacker they write reports about.

## 📜 Methodology: The 4 Laws of Root Lock

1. **Enumerate Harder.**  
   Find the crack. Widen it. Shatter it.

2. **Exploit Manually.**  
   Anyone can click. Not everyone can conquer.

3. **Document Like a Killer.**  
   The only difference between a weapon and a tool… is how you wield it.

4. **Reflect Ruthlessly.**  
   You don’t need to win every day.  
   You just need to become someone who *can’t lose twice.*

## 🔥 Final Words

This is **not** a game.  
This is **war against mediocrity.**  
You want the OSCP?  
Then become the one who **takes it.**

**Welcome to Project Root Lock.**  
*Unlock every system.  
But never, ever… unlock yourself.*
